## 🧠 Overview
**SmartAgri Advisor** is an intelligent crop recommendation system that helps farmers make data-driven decisions for better yield and profit.  
The system uses **Machine Learning (ML)** models to recommend the most suitable crops for a region based on environmental and market parameters such as **soil type**, **average temperature**, **rainfall**, and **humidity**.


## 🎯 Aim
To develop a smart, data-driven system that recommends the best crop for a specific region and season using predictive analytics and machine learning.

##  Problem Statement

Farmers must decide which crop to plant in a given region and season, but this decision is affected by multiple variables — soil type, average temperature, rainfall, location, and market demand. The lack of a systematic, data-driven approach leads to sub-optimal choices, resource misuse, and lower profitability. The project addresses the need for a system that uses multi-dimensional input data to provide precise, actionable crop recommendations tailored to specific conditions.


## ⚙️ Functional Workflow
1. **User Input:** Soil type, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and location.  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction from dataset.  
3. **ML Model Prediction:** Model predicts the most suitable crop using trained data.  
4. **Result Display:** The system outputs the recommended crop with supporting insights (market trends, average yield, etc.).  
5. **Future Scope:** Integration with IoT sensors and real-time weather APIs.
